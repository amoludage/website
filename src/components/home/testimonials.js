They have been able to meet our targets despite strict requirements and tight timelines on all three projects. Due to the highly customized nature of the ERP solutions and the Android app, requirements were often increased in scope or new requirements added as the projects progressed. Despite all these, Josh Software delivered and we are more than happy to work with them on upcoming projects.",

They had worked with a lot of startups across the world with good customer feedback on quality as well as timelines. We had a heard a lot of horror stories faced by startups about outsourced tech work so we kept our fingers crossed after they started work , but to our absolute delight Josh has functioned as an extended IT dept of our startup. They are very good at execution as well as providing suggestions/advice. They have delivered as per their estimates and forecasts of time and effort .I will strongly recommend them for any startup who wants to be lean and efficient.",

In many urgent situations, Josh managers and developers have gone many extra miles to make a deliverable happen by a key deadline. With regard to technology, the Josh team's knowledge of Ruby, Postgres, Rest APIs, AWS, Regex, web crawling, data management, and systems integration far exceed all other non-US resources and frankly have proven to be much better than many Silicon Valley developers that we have worked with in the past. Along with modern software development stack, Josh team also uses modern development tools including Pivotaltracker, Github and provide detailed status updates to manage the project and keep our executives informed. The Josh team takes great pride in their work, takes great care to ensure their clients' success, and we have grown to feel strongly that our Josh team is part of the family in our venture.
